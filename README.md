## About

In the context of my master degree at [HES-SO](https://www.hes-so.ch), I had to work on a interdisciplinary project about the installation of solar panels on cycle lanes in Switzerland. Data and calulations was made by two colleagues from Data Science and Energy Engineering. I created this web app to visualize the results.
